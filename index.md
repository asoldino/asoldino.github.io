## Why effects?
Not every possible problem can be described in terms of pure functions, and let's admit it, without the notorious side effects it is not even possible to write meaningful computer programs.

Let's start from a very simple example:

```scala
def divide(num: Int, den: Int): Int = num / den
```

Whilst it is pretty obvious what this function does, can it really be evaluated for _every_ combination of num and den? Quite unsurprisingly, not: in fact what happens when den is _0_?

```scala
val plusInfinite = divide(42, 0)

java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
at .divide(<console>:12)
... 38 elided
```

Even admitting there is a way for an Int to host the mathematical equivalent of infinite, a `java.lang.ArithmeticException` is quite outside the codomain of _Int_, isn't it? Something is not quite right, but living with exceptions is quite normal for every programmer.

So, is this already the end of the functional programming dream? Is even a simple arithmetic division not possible? Of course not, but it is necessary to rethink about the codomain a little. From mathematics, we know that it is not possible (for natural numbers) to divide by zero: this means that the codomain must be aware of that. This is when effects come into play!

A natural way of modelling such a situation is the following:

```scala
sealed trait MaybeInt
case class JustA(n: Int) extends MaybeInt
case class Nothing extends MaybeInt
```

Following this reasoning, we just modeled a type that can disjointly express the presence of a number (JustA(42)) or Nothing, in case an error occurred (we tried to divide by zero). Turns out that in many languages it is possible to add template parameters to type, such that the same effect can be applied to integers, strings, DatabaseRowBeans, et. al.

In scala, this class of effects is called Option[+A] (for every type A):

```scala
sealed abstract class Option[+A] extends Product with Serializable {...}
final case class Some[+A] {...}
case object None extends Option[Nothing] {...}

val someInt: Option[Int] = Some(42)
val noInt: Option[Int] = None
```

With this new tool at our disposal, we can now rewrite divide:

```scala
def betterDivide(num: Int, den: Int): Option[Int] = (num, den) match {
  case (_, 0)          => None
  case (a, b)          => Some(a / b)
}
```

Here, using a pattern match betterDivide is defined, such that any number divided by 0 returns None, otherwise Some(result). The full domain is now covered by the codomain.

```scala
betterDivide(1, 2)
res4: Option[Int] = Some(0)

betterDivide(2, 1)
res5: Option[Int] = Some(2)

betterDivide(2, 0)
res6: Option[Int] = None
```

Wrapping the result into an effect was necessary to retain a predictable result in case of errors. It is not without price though, for example this code would not compile:

```scala
val result = betterDivide(42, betterDivide(25, 2))

Error:(29, 38) type mismatch;
found   : Option[Int]
required: Int
betterDivide(2, betterDivide(2, 2))
```

It is necessary to "unwrap" the value from the effect first. Option offers an API named `get` to the rescue:

```scala
betterDivide(2, betterDivide(2, 2).get)

res7: Option[Int] = Some(2)
```
